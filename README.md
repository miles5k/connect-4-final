connect four final

Instructions:
this is a two player game where each player will select 1-7 to select the column they wish to go.




Dependencies:
none no libraries or modules are neccessary 



Future work:
- In the future I will need to add win conditions so when four in arow is mathed vertically horizonally and diagonally it will end the game. 
- I also need to add a tie condition as well for when the board is filled up and there is no four in a row
